# **Connect Four**
> "Fun for the whole family!" - Andrew Parke

## *Getting Started:*
* Drop a game piece at one of the highlighted cells by clicking on it.
* <span style="color: #00ffff">Teal</span> places the first piece and <span style="color: #ff0000">Red</span> follows, alternating turns.
* The player's turn is indicated by the color of the drop-landing indication rings.
* The first player to connect four pieces of the same color in a row (whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If neither player wins by the time the all of the board's cells are filled, the game is tied.
* Click on the RESET button to play again.
